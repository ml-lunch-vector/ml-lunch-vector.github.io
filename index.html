      <h3>Format and Theme</h3>
      <p>For the Fall 2024 semester, our talk theme is: <b>Discoveries and Mysteries</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Student talk (~20 minutes):
          <ul>
            <li><b>Discoveries (~10 minutes):</b> <em>One or two recent results</em> that set the stage for the second half. The results may be derived from your own research or previous work. Consider taking a critical eye towards the presented results and discussing their limitations as well.</li>
            <li><b>Mysteries (~10 minutes):</b> <em>One or two open questions, or areas you think are currently overlooked or misunderstood.</em> Each mystery should be motivated, e.g. by the discoveries in the first half or by preliminary results of your own work. Consider explaining what is counterintuitive about each mystery or giving a hypothesis for what a solution could look like.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Audience questions (~10 minutes)</li>
        <li>Socializing, unstructured discussion, and finishing lunch (30 minutes)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Possible themes for future semesters:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Things I Wish I Knew About ___ (Tutorial)</li>
        <li>How Did We Get Here? (Historical review)</li>
        <li>I Can't Believe It's Not Better</li>
        <li>Folk Knowledge</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please let us know if you have ideas for themes!</p>
